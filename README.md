# MindMate — Offline AI Mental Health Companion App


**Explore, Experience, and Evaluate the Future of On-Device Generative AI **

The MindMate is an experimental app that puts the power of cutting-edge Generative AI models directly into your hands which is a modified version of Googles AI-edge gallery, running entirely on your Android *(available now)* and iOS *(coming soon)* devices. Dive into a world of creative and practical AI use cases, all running locally, without needing an internet connection once the model is loaded. Experiment with different models, chat, ask questions with images and audio clip, explore prompts, and more!

MindMate is a calm, privacy-first mental health support app built on top of Google’s AI Edge demo architecture.
It uses offline large language model (LLM) inference via Gemma / llama.cpp to deliver supportive, empathetic conversations, mood tracking, and daily reflections — all without internet connectivity.

Install the apk from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/AshwinKumarBV-git/MindMate/releases/download/v0.1.0/MindMateV01.apk)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must uninstall all previous versions of the app before installing this one. Past versions will no longer be working and supported.
